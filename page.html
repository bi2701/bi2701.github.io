This bot does not collect, store, or share any personal user data. It does not log messages, monitor conversations, or track user activity.

However, certain commands may interact with third-party services (such as AI platforms, search engines, or content providers like Pinterest). These services may process user queries externally in order to generate responses or fetch content. Any data processed by those services is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of use.

By using this bot, users acknowledge that external APIs or tools may be triggered based on specific commands, and that those services may handle information independently from this bot. No personal account data, login credentials, or private content is accessed or stored by the bot.

If you have concerns about how third-party services manage data, we recommend reviewing their privacy policies directly.
