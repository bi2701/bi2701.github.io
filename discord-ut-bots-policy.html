🔐 Privacy Policy for Discord UT Bots
Last updated: July 7, 2025 Issued by: is_cool/bi2701

🧾 1. Introduction
This privacy policy explains how Discord UT Bots (“we,” “our,” or “the bot”) handles personal information in the course of providing command-based utilities, entertainment, and productivity features through Discord. We respect user privacy and are committed to keeping data handling transparent and minimal.

💡 2. Data Collection and Logging
We do not collect, store, or share personal information such as:

Discord usernames

Message contents

Guild (server) metadata

IP addresses

The bot does not log messages, monitor conversations, or track individual user activity.

All commands are processed in real-time only, and no history or content is retained by the bot.

🌐 3. Third-Party Services
Some commands may interact with third-party APIs or services, including but not limited to:

AI platforms (e.g. Shapes.INC)

Search engines

News services (e.g. BBC)

Content providers (e.g. Pinterest, YouTube)

These services may:

Receive user-inputted queries temporarily

Return externally generated content

Process requests based on their own privacy policie

We do not control or store any data processed by these external services. We recommend users review the privacy policies of those platforms for more information.

4. Authentication and User Accounts
The bot does not authenticate users or require login credentials.

If future features involve login via services like Pinterest (OAuth), users will be asked to provide explicit consent, and any authorization tokens will be handled securely.

No credentials are stored or used to impersonate users.

5. Legal Compliance
We aim to follow international standards, including:

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for EU users

California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for California residents

Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) — no features are marketed toward or knowingly used by individuals under the age of 13

Users may revoke access to third-party services at any time via Discord settings or OAuth platform interfaces.
