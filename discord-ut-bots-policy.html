  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This privacy policy explains how Discord UT Bots (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe bot‚Äù) handles personal information in the course of providing command-based utilities, entertainment, and productivity features through Discord. We respect user privacy and are committed to keeping data handling transparent and minimal.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection and Logging</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or share personal information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discord usernames</li>
    <li>Message contents</li>
    <li>Guild (server) metadata</li>
    <li>IP addresses</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The bot does not log messages, monitor conversations, or track individual user activity.<br>
     All commands are processed in real-time only, and no history or content is retained by the bot.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Some commands may interact with third-party APIs or services, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI platforms (e.g. Shapes.INC)</li>
    <li>Search engines</li>
    <li>News services (e.g. BBC)</li>

  <p>These services may:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Receive user-inputted queries temporarily</li>
    <li>Return externally generated content</li>
    <li>Process requests based on their own privacy policies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not control or store any data processed by these external services. We recommend users review the privacy policies of those platforms for more information.</p>

  <h2>4. Authentication and User Accounts</h2>
  <p>The bot does not authenticate users or require login credentials.</p>
  <p>If future features involve login via services like Pinterest (OAuth), users will be asked to provide explicit consent, and any authorization tokens will be handled securely.<br>
     No credentials are stored or used to impersonate users.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>No features are marketed toward or knowingly used by individuals under the age of 13.<br>
